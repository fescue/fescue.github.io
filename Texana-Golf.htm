			<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.lnra.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Lake Texana</a> (also known as <span style='font-weight:bold'>Palmetto Bend</span>) is located seven miles east of Edna in Jackson County, on the Navidad River, a major tributary to the Lavaca River. Lake Texana is named after the ghost town of Texana which the lake submerged.  The lake and dam are managed by the <span style='font-weight:bold'>Lavaca–Navidad River Authority</span> for water supply and recreational purposes. United States Congress authorized the Palmetto Bend Reclamation Project in 1968.</p>
			<p>Texana Golf is near Texas metropolitan areas, located approximately <span style='font-weight:bold'>70 miles southwest of Houston</span> and <span style='font-weight:bold'>95 miles southeast of San Antonio</span>, a little over an hour drive from the perimeter of each city.</p>
			<p>The development plan envisions a destination-scale property focused on its <span style='font-weight:bold'>two golf courses</span>, clubhouse, practice grounds, and limited lodging amenities. Potential routing options look to maximize shoreline golf interaction while preserving extensive woodland, wetland, and floodplain buffers consistent with the reservoir’s environmental setting.  New golf design with expansive lakefront holes is rare.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>West Course (approximately 190 acres)</h2>
			<p>The <span style='font-weight:bold'>West Course</span> will occupy the central and eastern shoreline of Lake Texana and is routed across a series of peninsulas and lake inlets. The map appears to have potential for continuous water adjacency, long reservoir views, and strong natural integration with coves and wetland corridors.</p>
			<p>The West Course design will be led by <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.tdagolf.net/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Tripp Davis and Associates</a>. <span style='font-weight:bold'>Tripp Davis</span> carries a championship golf pedigree as an <span style='font-weight:bold'>NCAA All-American</span> and member of the University of Oklahoma’s 1989 national championship team. the firm brings more than <span style='font-weight:bold'>30 years of golf course architecture experience</span> and a portfolio that includes <span style='font-weight:bold'>new course designs</span> as well as extensive renovation/restoration work at historic clubs including Augusta Country Club, Gasparilla Inn, Northwood, Oak Hills Country Club, Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club, <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://fescue.github.io/Ridgewood-Country-Club-Waco/' target='_blank'>Ridgewood-Country-Club</a> in Waco, Wichita Country Club.</p>
			<p>Notable work in new golf course design is highlighted at <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://fescue.github.io/The-Rose/' target='_blank'>The Rose</a> in Georgia and restoration of past Ryder Cup site <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://fescue.github.io/Thunderbird-Country-Club/' target='_blank'>Thunderbird Country Club</a>.  The Rose has the potential to host future NCAA college golf national championships with the University of Georgia as host.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>East Course (approximately 190 acres)</h2>
			<p>The <span style='font-weight:bold'>East Course</span> will be located on the south part of the site on two distinct parcels on the lake with the potential to balance shoreline golf with inland holes framed by native vegetation. Routing choices emerging from topographic maps to landscape clearance will expose the choices for fairway corridor width to capture substantial lake frontage and views.</p>
			<p>The East Course will be designed by <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.jacksonkahndesign.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Jackson Kahn Design</a> led by <span style='font-weight:bold'>Tim Jackson and David Kahn</span>. Founded in 2009, the firm’s principals educational background in <span style='font-weight:bold'>Agronomy and Landscape Architecture</span>, coupled with more than <span style='font-weight:bold'>$600 million in completed project experience</span> on prominent new golf course design gives this team experience building across a wide range of environments and construction scopes.</p>
			<p>Jackson Kahn Design has contributed to projects as both contracted golf architect and lead design associates including <span style='font-weight:bold'>Monterey Peninsula Country Club (Dunes Course)</span> in California, <span style='font-weight:bold'>Wayzata Country Club</span> in Minnesota, <span style='font-weight:bold'>Conway Farms</span> in Illinois, and the <span style='font-weight:bold'>Rolling Hills short course</span> in Arizona, with an anticipated new course at <span style='font-weight:bold'>Kettle Forge</span> in Wisconsin.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>Golf Course Construction</h2>
			<p>Golf course construction will be led by <span style='font-weight:bold'>Wolf Point Golf Co.</span>, a golf construction company led by <span style='font-weight:bold'>Don Mahaffey</span> and <span style='font-weight:bold'>Ryan Mahaffey</span>. The team is noted for its experience on the <span style='font-weight:bold'>Memorial Park renovation</span> in Houston with <span style='font-weight:bold'>Tom Doak and Mike Nuzzo</span> and for Mahaffey’s construction lead role building nearby <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://golf.com/course/wolf-point/' target='_blank'>Wolf Point</a> with golf architect Mike Nuzzo.  Mahaffey worked with Tripp Davis previously at Braeburn Country Club in Houston in 2022 and San Angelo Country Club in 2025.</p>

			<h2>Clubhouse, Practice, and Lodging</h2>
			<p>A centrally located <span style='font-weight:bold'>Clubhouse and Practice Area (approximately 17.1 acres)</span> serves both courses efficiently, while a small cabins and lodging area is positioned on higher ground to the northwest separated from core golf.</p>
