			<H1>Two-Course Destination Plan – Texana Preserve</H1>

			<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.lnra.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Lake Texana</a> (also known as <span style='font-weight:bold'>Palmetto Bend Dam and Reservoir, Stage I</span>) is located seven miles east of Edna in Jackson County, on the Navidad River, a major tributary to the Lavaca River. Lake Texana is named after the ghost town of Texana which the lake merged. The project originally derives its name from the dwarf palmetto (<em>Sabal minor</em>), a common bottomland plant in the area. The lake and dam are managed by the <span style='font-weight:bold'>Lavaca–Navidad River Authority</span> for municipal and industrial water supply and recreational purposes. The Congress of the United States authorized the Palmetto Bend Reclamation Project in October, 1968.</p>

			<p>Texana Preserve is strategically positioned between two major Texas metropolitan areas, located approximately <span style='font-weight:bold'>120 miles southwest of Houston</span> and <span style='font-weight:bold'>95 miles northeast of San Antonio</span>, placing the site within a two-hour drive of both markets.</p>

			<p>The master plan envisions a destination-scale golf development organized around <span style='font-weight:bold'>two full-length golf courses</span>, a shared clubhouse and practice core, and limited lodging amenities. The routing concept maximizes shoreline golf while preserving extensive woodland, wetland, and floodplain buffers consistent with the reservoir’s environmental setting.</p>

			<h2>East Course (approximately 190 acres)</h2>
			<p>The <span style='font-weight:bold'>East Course</span> occupies the central and eastern shoreline of Lake Texana and is routed across a series of narrow peninsulas and lake inlets. The plan emphasizes continuous water adjacency, long reservoir views, and strong natural separation between holes using coves and wetland corridors.</p>

			<p>The East Course is designed by <span style='font-weight:bold'>Tripp Davis and Associates</span>. Founded by <span style='font-weight:bold'>Tripp Davis</span>, an <span style='font-weight:bold'>NCAA All-American</span> and member of the University of Oklahoma’s 1989 national championship team, the firm brings more than <span style='font-weight:bold'>30 years of golf course architecture experience</span> and a portfolio that includes <span style='font-weight:bold'>19 award-winning new course designs</span> as well as extensive restoration work at historic clubs.</p>

			<p>Recent work includes the new golf course <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://fescue.github.io/The-Rose/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>The Rose (Georgia)</a>.</p>

			<h2>West Course (approximately 190 acres)</h2>
			<p>The <span style='font-weight:bold'>West Course</span> is located to the southwest on broader landforms and balances shoreline golf with inland holes framed by native vegetation. Compared with the East Course, the West Course appears to feature wider corridors and a more land-based rhythm, while still capturing substantial lake frontage and views.</p>

			<p>The West Course is designed by <span style='font-weight:bold'>Jackson Kahn Design</span>, led by <span style='font-weight:bold'>Tim Jackson and David Kahn</span>. Founded in 2009, the firm’s educational backgrounds in <span style='font-weight:bold'>Agronomy and Landscape Architecture</span>, coupled with more than <span style='font-weight:bold'>$600 million in completed project experience</span>, supports execution across a wide range of environments and construction scopes—from remodels to new builds.</p>

			<p>Jackson Kahn Design has contributed to projects including <span style='font-weight:bold'>Monterey Peninsula Country Club (Dunes Course)</span> in California, <span style='font-weight:bold'>Wayzata Country Club</span> in Minnesota, <span style='font-weight:bold'>Conway Farms</span> in Illinois, and the <span style='font-weight:bold'>Rolling Hills short course</span> in Arizona, with an anticipated new course at <span style='font-weight:bold'>Kettle Forge</span> in Wisconsin.</p>

			<h2>Golf Course Construction</h2>
			<p>Golf course construction is led by <span style='font-weight:bold'>Wolf Point Golf Co.</span>, a golf construction company led by <span style='font-weight:bold'>Don Mahaffey</span> and <span style='font-weight:bold'>Ryan Mahaffey</span>. The team is noted for its experience on the <span style='font-weight:bold'>Memorial Park renovation</span> in Houston with <span style='font-weight:bold'>Tom Doak</span>, and for Mahaffey’s construction lead role building the new golf course in Luling: <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://fescue.github.io/Luling-Sport/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Luling Sport</a>.</p>

			<h2>Clubhouse, Practice, and Lodging</h2>
			<p>A centrally located <span style='font-weight:bold'>Clubhouse and Practice Area (approximately 17.1 acres)</span> serves both courses efficiently, while a small cabins and lodging area is positioned on higher ground to the northeast, separated from primary golf corridors.</p>
      <p><a href="https://riversbarden.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rivers Barden Architects</strong></a> is a Houston-based architectural firm specializing in site-responsive design that thoughtfully integrates buildings with landscape, climate, and regional context.</p>
      <p>Led by principals Kevin Barden and Joe Rivers—both alumni of The Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture—the firm brings a deep understanding of materials, daylighting, and indoor-outdoor connections.</p>
      <p>Their experience designing golf clubhouses and working in Gulf Coast climates makes them ideally suited to create a clubhouse that embraces Texana Golf Resort’s lakeside setting.</p>
